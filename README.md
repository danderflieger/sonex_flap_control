# Sonex Flap Control
This is an Arduino project to move flaps and display current flap angle on small OLED screen. 

My Sonex kit came with a Flap Actuator with a feedback circuit (e.g. it has 5 wires). It will require an H-type motor driver and a small OLED screen as well as some buttons to select the flap setting.
